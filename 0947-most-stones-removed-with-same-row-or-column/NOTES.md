1) Graph-based: Form an undirected graph between all the coordinates which are either on same x-axis or y-axis. Then, calculate the number of connected components in the graph(as in that connected component all but one coordinates can be removed) and subtract that with the total number of coordinates present. TC - O(n2+n) SC - O(n)
2) Optimized DFS or DSU: Forming graph is a difficult task(O(n2)) but if that can be reduced(to, say, O(n)) then the overall TC can be reduced. This can be achieved by forming two components, one b/w all X-sharing coords and one b/w all Y-sharing coords, and then an edge b/w X-sharing and Y-sharing for any (x,y). TC - O(n) SC - O(n). YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
