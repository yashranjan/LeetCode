Observations:
1. The number of rows to be traversed in case of odd n will be 1 more than even,i.e., i<(n+1)/2
2. The number of columns will still remain the same irrespective of n
3. Transpose(swaping along diagonal) + Reflect(swaping along vertical center) is easier to write though has lot more read/write compared to first approach of swapping 4 variables at a time
