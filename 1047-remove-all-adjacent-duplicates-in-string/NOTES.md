1) Naive solution - Store all 2-characters possibilities in a hashset, and search-replace them in the string repeatedly. TC - O(n2) SC - O(1)
2) Two-pointers - Take two pointers, each pointing to the two characters for comparison. Convert string to list(can be made work with just strings as well, but each concatenation will increase the TC). Then if the two pointers don't match, increment both of them. Else, if they match, remove them(by setting them as ""), and decrement left pointer and increment right pointer. A stack needs to be maintained to keep track of safe position on the left side, else if no such position exists, then left pointer can be made pointed to the right pointer and right needs to be incremented. This can go on till the right pointer is exhausted. TC - O(n) SC - O(n)
3) Â Stack-based - Keep a stack and keep pushing characters into it, if it doesn't match with the top-most character. If it does match, skip the current character and pop the top. At the end, join and return the characters left in the stack. TC - O(n) SC - O(n)
