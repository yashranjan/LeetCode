Approaches:
1. Use a hashset to store all the positive numbers found in the list and then traverse from 1 till the maximum positive number seen, and check wether or not that exists in the hashset. TC -O(n) SC-O(n)
2. Use array as a hashmap. But before doing so, check if 1 already exists or not if it doesn't that's the answer, else replace all the negative values(including 0) and the values greater than n(since the answer will be either <=n or n+1) to 1. And then use the indices of the array as a key to mark wether a certain value is seen or not. After that, traverse all the indices and if any index has a positive value, then that index is the answer. TC - O(n) SC-O(1) NOTE: This will destory the array.
3. To not destroy the array, swap the elements recursively, which can be swapped, to their desired location(i.e val-1). Then traverse the array and return the index of the first index for which the element present is not correct, else return length of the list+1. TC-O(n) SC-O(1)
